Implementation of Dinic's algorithm. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinic%27s_algorithm

This was one of my first projects, therefore may contain several issues or lack optimazation. 
A known issue is the implementation of the wrong search algorithm for optimal paths. (Uses BFS instead of DFS)

Maybe the code is helpfull for someone out there
